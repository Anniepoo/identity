# Identity

An identity management system for SWI-Prolog.

# What it is

Almost every web application has the notion of a user, with an account,
a profile, and some privileges.

And signing up for and maintaining this is pretty much done the same
way, with slight variations, everywhere.

And it can get messy and complex to do. There's no reason for everybody
to do it over and over.

I need a library like this. I'm writing one.

## License

A license file should accompany this software. The intent is that
this software should be easily integrated with SWI-Prolog license.
